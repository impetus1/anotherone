    <h2>Florida Free Appliance Pickup</h2>
    <p>is a free appliance pick up service serving Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Sarasota, and New Port Richey since 2014, licensed and insured to remove your junk and appliances. Leave us a voicemail and get reliable service within the next 1 to 2 business days. 
      We can safely remove, haul away, and recycle all metals-materials and major appliances. We work with both residential and commercial property owners and provide piece of mind to homeowners, business owners, and property managers, so no haul is too big or small!</p>
    <p>We serve the central Florida region and are the trusted source for your unwanted appliance and metal pickup needs. How this typically works is a crew will come to your property and pick up your appliances from an accessible location such as the front of your garage. 
      Working appliances are donated to several different organizations and non working appliances are properly recycled. We follow EPA standards for the proper disposal of a broad array of hazardous materials including local regulations regarding appliance recycling for Freon, foam plastics, mercury, and metals. </p>
