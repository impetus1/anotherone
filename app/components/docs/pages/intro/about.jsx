<h2>A little bit of background about us:</h2>
<p>Florida Free Appliance Pickup was formed as a privately held company last year. We are a family company based out of Tampa, Florida and have been expanding to surrounding cities since 2015. Today, we operate in 6 counties and 26 different municipalities. We have had the pleasure of serving homeowners and businesses all around Central Florida and continue to grow to surrounding areas.</p>
<h2>What is our goal?</h2>
<p>We are trying to provide a decent way for people to properly dispose of their appliances in a manner which is environmentally friendly. We do this by proper management of hazardous materials which, otherwise ignored, could pose a safety risk or that of an environmental risk by properly recycling chlorofluorocarbons(Freon), oils, mercury, and foam plastics such as polystyrene.</p>
<h2>Services provided:</h2>
<p>We aid in the recycling of unused or unwanted appliances by providing a free appliance pickup or removal from the property where it's located. We then sort and recycle the different materials and then donate the functional appliances if we receive them in a functional state and work with different not-for-profit companies in order donate functional appliances.</p>
<p>If a pickup is urgent and it's an emergency, then we may be able to help if you relay that information to us and we can schedule an emergency pickup within the day, we will prioritize that pickup and try to get to you as soon as we can. Typically, a normal pickup will take 1-2 business days however, if our schedule permits, we will try to get you a pickup on Saturday as well. In most cases, we are able to get there same day.</p>
<h3>We try our best to get to every pickup and strive to get there as soon as possible. The best way to reach us is via the pickup request provided on the site, otherwise you can email us <a href="mailto:begreentampa@gmail.com?Subject=Appliance%20request" target="_top">here.</a></h3>
