For the uninitiated--
a major issue creating spas in 2017-18 was the problem of seamless integration of sidebars(not using material) with a regular site. Jquery is excellent for this in that the pages containing snippets of html(jsx) were just blocks. It's easy to get involved with xpath in jquery so as to differentiate react containers from components but the problem is simple: for each component, react-dom appoints a href link to them and gives them state. 
Jquery then just has to read state, handle lifecycle for the sidebar, and return a condition as a for loop subroutine to provide an updated 'block' for state change, for the href. 
It is important to showcase the need for jquery in that its power lies in its ability to get files ($ method) (https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-get-selected-file-name-from-input-type-file-using-jquery.php) so that a file (such as for a form) lies in the cache and then can be posted with a submit function which can be found with a react or html post(rest) function to handle form submission. 
Also important is how tiny the codebase is and how few node packages are needed :)
Any questions should just be raised as an issue in this repo, or just email me (check the tou/privacy policy).
